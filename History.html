        <p>
          Bacolod, often referred to as the "City of Smiles," traces its history
          back to the early 18th century when settlers from Panay Island
          established a small settlement along the banks of the Magsungay River.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city experienced significant growth during the Spanish colonial
          period, becoming a hub for sugarcane production and trade. It was
          officially recognized as a town in 1755 and later as a city in 1938.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bacolod played a crucial role in the Philippine Revolution against
          Spanish rule, and later, during the American period, it emerged as a
          center of commerce and education in the Visayas region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Bacolod is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant
          festivals, and warm hospitality, making it a popular destination for
          tourists and a beloved home for its residents.
